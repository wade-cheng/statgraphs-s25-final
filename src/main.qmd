## Introduction

Baseball, the great American pastime, makes over ten billion dollars year over 
year [@cohen_2024_mlb], draws millions to stadiums across the nation 
[@attendence_2023], and is played recreationally at parks and schools every
single fortnight, or something. After too many times malding at the TV over
terrible plays or inscrutable ball trajectories, we decided it would be 
interesting to pick apart some data to reveal more objective insights into this
popular game.

Our dataset [@jcraggy_2020_baseball] comes from a Kaggle model-creating 
competition to predict home runs. It has 46,244 recordings that represent each
batted ball from the 2020 MLB season (which was abbreviated due to COVID---60
games were played instead of the usual 162). The dataset did include postseason
games. 

Each recording had twenty-five variables. We analyzed the subset below:

**TODO: bold variables you use!**
**This will help us remove items we didn't use, later**

- bip_id: unique identifier of ball in play
- game_date: date of game (YYYY-MM-DD)
- home_team: home team abbreviation
- away_team: away team abbreviation
- batter_team: batter's team abbreviation
- batter_name: batter's name
- pitcher_name: pitcher's name
- batter_id: batter's unique identifier
- pitcher_id: pitcher's unique identifier
- **is_batter_lefty: binary encoding of left-handed batters**
- **is_pitcher_lefty: binary encoding of left-handed pitchers**
- bb_type: batted ball type classification
- **bearing: horizontal direction classification of ball leaving the bat (i.e. 'left' ball is traveling to the left side of the field)**
- pitch_name: name of pitch type thrown
- park: unique identifier of park venue
- inning: inning number within game
- outs_when_up: current number of outs
- balls: current number of balls
- strikes: current number of strikes
- plate_x: ball position left(-) or right(+) of center plate (feet)
- plate_z: ball position above home plate (feet)
- pitch_mph: speed of pitched ball (miles per hour)
- launch_speed: speed of ball leaving the bat (miles per hour)
- launch_angle: vertical angle of ball leaving the bat (degrees relative to horizontal)
- is_home_run: binary encoding of home runs

<!-- NOTE: feel free to change "special focus" if you change your main variable -->

With these variables, we aimed to investigate anything that might help a team
win a game of baseball, with special focus on ball bearing, inning number, launch
angle, and hit location.

## Results

### Bearing

Ball bearing is correlated with player handedness.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# mar
# A numerical vector of the form c(bottom, left, top, right) which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on the four sides of the plot. The default is c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(6,1,4,1))
batter = table(baseball$bearing, baseball$is_batter_lefty)
dimnames(batter) <- list(
  c("left", "center", "right"),
  c("right \nhanded","left \nhanded")
) 

mosaicplot(
  batter, 
  shade=TRUE, 
  las=1,
  main="Batter handedness vs bearing"
  #ylab=c("test","test2","dsf")
)
# text( .2,.6, "TEMP GRAHHHHHHHH",col = "black",cex = 0.5) 
rasterImage(png::readPNG("media/Wii_batter_lefth.png"), xleft=0.4, ybottom=0, xright=0.6, ytop=0.4)
rasterImage(png::readPNG("media/Wii_batter_righth.png"), xleft=0.4, ybottom=0.5, xright=0.6, ytop=0.9)

# reverse bearing for better visualization (pitcher's pov is right center left)
rev_bearing = factor(baseball$bearing, levels=c("right", "center", "left"))
pitcher = table(rev_bearing, baseball$is_pitcher_lefty)
dimnames(pitcher) <- list(
  c("right", "center", "left"),
  c("right \nhanded","left \nhanded")
) 
mosaicplot(
  pitcher, 
  shade=TRUE, 
  las=1,
  main="Pitcher handedness vs bearing"
)
rasterImage(png::readPNG("media/Wii_pitcher_lefth.png"), xleft=0.3, ybottom=0.2, xright=0.6, ytop=0.5)
rasterImage(png::readPNG("media/Wii_pitcher_righth.png"), xleft=0.3, ybottom=0.7, xright=0.6, ytop=1)
```


### Inning

Inning affects pitching and batting gameplay.

### Launch angle

Some variables we want to explore further are launch angle and pitch speed in relation to game performance. In this section, we ask if launch angle and pitch speed correlate with each other, and what ways do they affect if a batted ball was a home run? 

To investigate these possible relationships, we first clean the baseball data to remove null values from pitch speed and launch angles. Then, we created a scatteplot between pitch speed (mph) and launch angles (degrees), colored by if a batted ball was a home run or not:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pitch_data <- baseball |> 
  filter(!is.na(launch_angle), !is.na(pitch_mph))

home_run_medians <- pitch_data |>
  filter(is_home_run == 1) |>
  summarise(
    median_launch_angle = median(launch_angle),
    median_pitch_speed = median(pitch_mph)
  )

ggplot(pitch_data, aes(x = launch_angle, y = pitch_mph, color = as.factor(is_home_run))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("0" = "gray", "1" = "red"), 
                     labels = c("No", "Yes")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = home_run_medians$median_launch_angle, 
             color = "orange", linetype = "solid") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = home_run_medians$median_pitch_speed, 
             color = "blue", linetype = "solid") + 
  annotate("text", 
           x = home_run_medians$median_launch_angle + 2,
           y = max(pitch_data$pitch_mph),
           label = paste("Median Launch Angle (HR):", round(home_run_medians$median_launch_angle, 2)), 
           color = "orange", hjust = 0) + 
  annotate("text", 
           x = min(pitch_data$launch_angle) + 15,
           y = home_run_medians$median_pitch_speed + 1,
           label = paste("Median Pitch Speed (HR):", round(home_run_medians$median_pitch_speed, 2)), 
           color = "blue", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 50, y = 87, label = "Linear Trend", color = "black", hjust = 0) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", size = 1.1) +
  labs(
    title = "Launch Angle vs. Pitch Speed by Home Run with Median Line",
    x = "Launch Angle (degrees)",
    y = "Pitch Speed (mph)",
    color = "Is Home Run"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```
We can see that home run balls appear to occur across all pitch speeds, not limited to certain ranges, whereas launch angles distinctly appear to have a specific range of values where home runs occur. The blue and orange lines represent the median values of pitch speed and launch angles respectively for home runs. We can compare these values with the overall median values of all the batted balls below: 

```{r}
overall_medians <- pitch_data |>
  summarise(
    median_launch_angle = median(launch_angle),
    median_pitch_speed = median(pitch_mph)
  )
overall_medians$median_launch_angle
overall_medians$median_pitch_speed
```
We see that the overall pitch speed median is extremely close to the median pitch speed for home runs, which makes sense since we did not find an obvious interval where home runs occur more for pitch speed. However, we find the value for overall median launch angle to be 13, which is much further than the median value of 28 for launch speed for home runs. Furthermore, a relatively horizontal linear trend indicates that pitch speed and launch angle do not seem to correlate with each other. As a result, we may want to dive deeper into the relationship between launch angles and home runs.

We can confirm whether launch angle is normal by looking at its Q-Q plot: 

```{r}
qqnorm(sampled_launch_angle, main = "Q-Q Plot of Launch Angles")
qqline(sampled_launch_angle, col = "red")
```
We find the the Q-Q plot for launch angles is S-shaped, and deviates at the ends of the line, which suggests heavy outliers that don't conform to the normal distribution. As a result, we confirm that the distribution for launch angle is not normal. 

Then, we cannot use a t test to check the mean values between overall batted balls and home run batted balls. However, since our sample size is so large, by the central limit theorem we can claim that the means will be approximately normal; then we can use a z test as opposed to a t test. Below we manually calculate the z test between home run launch angles and non-home run launch angles:

```{r}
home_run_data <- pitch_data |>
  filter(is_home_run == 1)

non_home_run_data <- pitch_data |>
  filter(is_home_run == 0)

z.test(x = home_run_data$launch_angle,
       y = non_home_run_data$launch_angle,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 0,
       sigma.x = sd(home_run_data$launch_angle),
       sigma.y = sd(non_home_run_data$launch_angle))
```
The results of the two-sample z-test here reveal a statistically significant difference in mean launch angles between home run and non-home run batted balls (p-value < 2.2e-16). Specifically, the mean launch angle for home runs is significantly higher than for non-home runs. This suggests that launch angle plays a critical role in determining whether a batted ball results in a home run. Therefore, we can conclude that launch angle is an important factor for predicting home run outcomes in baseball.

To further explore the relationship between launch angle and the likelihood of a home run, we can fit a logistic regression model. This model predicts the probability of a home run as a function of the launch angle, and it makes sense given home run is a binary variable. However, given that only a select portion of angles have home runs within them, we can consider a quadratic regression (the probability of home run increases, then decreases). Below are the summary for each regression model: 

```{r}
min(home_run_data$launch_angle)
max(home_run_data$launch_angle)

pitch_data_filtered <- pitch_data |>
  filter(!is.na(is_home_run)) |>
  filter(launch_angle >= 10 & launch_angle <= 50)

glm.out <- glm(is_home_run ~ launch_angle, data = pitch_data_filtered, family = binomial)

summary(glm.out)

quad_model <- glm(is_home_run ~ launch_angle + I(launch_angle^2), 
                  family = binomial, 
                  data = pitch_data)
summary(quad_model)

```
Comparing the two model's AIC values, we determine that the quadratic mdoel is better as it has a lower AIC value. Now, we can graph the quadratic model probabilities: 

```{r}
launch_angle_seq <- seq(min(pitch_data_filtered$launch_angle), 
                        max(pitch_data_filtered$launch_angle), 
                        length.out = 300)

predicted_data <- data.frame(launch_angle = launch_angle_seq)

predicted_data$predicted_prob <- predict(quad_model, 
                                         newdata = predicted_data, 
                                         type = "response")
ggplot(pitch_data_filtered, aes(x = launch_angle, y = is_home_run)) +
  geom_line(data = predicted_data, aes(x = launch_angle, y = predicted_prob), color = "lightblue", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Home Run vs. Launch Angle",
    x = "Launch Angle (degrees)",
    y = "Predicted Probability of Home Run"
  )
```
From the graph above, we see that the relationship follows a bell-shaped curve, where the probability of hitting a home run increases up until about 30 degrees, and then decreases as the launch angle becomes higher. This suggests that there is an optimal launch angle range to hit a home run; a quadratic regression model explains this non-linear relationship well. We can also find the "best" angle according to this model by finding the peak value: 
```{r}
coef_quad <- coef(quad_model)
peak_launch_angle <- -coef_quad["launch_angle"] / (2 * coef_quad["I(launch_angle^2)"])
peak_launch_angle
```
So the best angle according to our model is 29.57494 degrees. 

### Hit location

Home runs are consistently hit in specific locations.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
baseball |>
  ggplot(aes(x = plate_x, y = plate_z)) +
  stat_density2d(aes(fill = after_stat(level)), geom = "polygon") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ fct_recode(factor(is_home_run), "Home Run" = "1", "Not Home Run" = "0")) + 
  labs(title = "Contour Plot of Plate Positions", x = "plate_x (feet)", y = "plate_z (feet)", 
       caption = "Note: red line is middle of plate") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", size = 1) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "Density Level") + 
  theme_bw()
```
